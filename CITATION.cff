notes: >
  We thank the M3’s MCP initial work from @rafiattrach, @rajna-fani, @MoreiraP12 for inspiration and which made our
  contributions to the MCPStack project. Innovations on top of M3 in this project include the use of
  Scikit-Learn-style pipelines for MCP tools rather than transformers / estimators.
