# ðŸ’¾ Saving & Loading Pipelines

Pipelines can be **serialized** to JSON and restored later. This makes sharing and reusing pipelines easy.

---

## 1. Saving

```python
stack.save("my_pipeline.json")
```

This writes:

```json
{
  "config": {...},
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "hello_world",
      "params": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## 2. Loading

```python
from MCPStack.stack import MCPStackCore

stack = MCPStackCore.load("my_pipeline.json")
```

The stack is reconstructed, tools are re-initialized, and actions re-registered.

---

## 3. CLI equivalents

```bash
# Save
mcpstack save --pipeline my_pipeline.json

# Load and run
mcpstack run --pipeline my_pipeline.json --config-type fastmcp
```

!!! note
    After loading, MCPStack calls each toolâ€™s `post_load()` hook to restore backends or connections.
