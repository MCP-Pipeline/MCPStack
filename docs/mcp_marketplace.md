# üõçÔ∏è MCPs Marketplace

Welcome to the **MCPStack MCPs Marketplace** ‚Äî the central hub where we list all supported MCPStack MCP tools, built by us and by the community. Each tile below represents a tool: what it does, and a link to its repository.

Whether you‚Äôre a researcher, clinician, or developer, the Marketplace helps you quickly discover, install, and stack tools into powerful pipelines.

## üöÄ How to Use an MCP Tool

All MCPStack-compatible tools must register themselves via an **entry point** in their `pyproject.toml`.  
This makes tools **auto-discoverable** once you `uv add` (or `pip install`) their repository.

```toml
[project.entry-points."mcpstack.tools"]
your_tool_name = "mcpstack_your_tool_name.tool:YourTool"
```

* ‚úÖ Once installed, `MCPStack` will detect the tool automatically.
* ‚ùå If detection fails, please open an issue @ [MCPStack/Issues](https://github.com/MCP-Pipeline/MCPStack).
